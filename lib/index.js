/**
 * Extracts and constructs a manifest object from an SPDX document for a given file.
 * This function processes an SPDX document, iterating over its packages to construct a manifest.
 * It handles package information, including name, version, and package URLs (purls), and categorizes packages as direct or indirect dependencies based on their relationships.
 * Special handling is applied to package URLs to work around encoding issues, using the `replaceVersionEscape` function.
 *
 * @param {Object} document - The SPDX document object containing package and relationship data.
 * @param {string} fileName - The name of the file from which the SPDX document was extracted.
 * @returns {Object} A manifest object containing the processed package data, including direct and indirect dependencies.
